"description":"BetterHelp is the convenient way to get professional help from a licensed therapist. With over 20,000 trained, experienced, and accredited therapists covering a wide range of areas – from depression and anxiety to family and couples therapy – it’s never been easier to receive personal, professional help when you need it.\n \n-------------------------------------------\nBETTERHELP – FEATURES\n-------------------------------------------\n• Over 20,000 licensed, accredited, and highly experienced therapists\n• Match with an available therapist who best fits your needs\n• Unlimited private one on one communication with your therapist\n• Schedule live sessions with your therapist or use the secure messenger\n• Gain access to constructive, educational group webinars\n \nPROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU\nFacing obstacles alone can be daunting – receiving support and guidance from a professional therapist has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we’ll match you to an available therapist who fits your objectives, preferences and the type of issues you’re dealing with. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.\n \nLICENSED AND TRAINED therapistS & THERAPISTS\nThere are over 20,000 therapists on BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D./PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional therapists (LPC), or similar credentials.\n \nAll of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice.\n \nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nAfter filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs and preferences. You and your therapist will get your own secure and private “therapy room” where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. You can also schedule a weekly session to speak live with your therapist over video or phone.\n \nYou can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions, and discuss the challenges you’re facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights, and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.\n \nTogether you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals, and overcoming your problems.\n \nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\nThe cost of therapy through BetterHelp ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your BetterHelp membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the therapy service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason.", "userRatingCount":53442},

Here’s what some of them have to say:\n\n“Talking anonymously with a listener made me feel safe enough to really open up.”\n\n“I can just message on my way home from work and it isn’t inconvenient like scheduling a therapist.”\n\n“I got undivided attention from someone who cared for the first time in a really, really long time.”\n\nEMOTIONAL SUPPORT ON DEMAND:\n\nFeeling stressed, anxious, or depressed? Having relationship problems? Sometimes you need to vent. Finding and scheduling a therapist can be time-consuming and expensive, and you can’t always open up to friends, family, or coworkers.\n\nNow you can get emotional support anytime, anywhere with 7 Cups.

No one will ever know who you are—not even your listeners or therapists.\n\nLISTENERS WHO CARE:\n\nOur listeners are volunteers. They aren’t getting paid; they’re here because they want to help.\n\nThey care.\n\nWe have over 450,000 trained listeners and licensed therapists to choose from. Listeners provide support across 189 countries and in 140 languages. Each listener has a profile with reviews and a list of categories that they specialize in, ranging from panic attacks and bullying to eating disorders, surviving a breakup, and more.\n\nWhen you find the listener you want, connect instantly via chat. Try a new listener each time, or pick one listener and develop a deeper ongoing relationship.\n\nFAST & FREE:\n\nThe app is free to download, and all listeners are 100% free.

"description":"Yelp Waitlist is now called Yelp Guest Manager! Same great features, just a new name that better speaks to our mission: helping restaurants provide a consistent guest experience, no matter where your diners find you.\n\nYelp Guest Manager helps restaurants manage all of their front-of-house operations across the entire dining experience through one fully integrated solution — by bringing together Yelp Waitlist, Reservations, Kiosk, Takeout, Table Management, online brand building and more into one product. Yelp Guest Manager combines Yelp’s high-intent diner network with powerful solutions that simplify and streamline restaurant operations from takeout and delivery orders to dine-in seating. \n\n*Note: This app is for Restaurant Businesses. If you're a diner, join a waitlist by searching ‘waitlist’ on the Yelp App!\n\nThe new Yelp Guest Manager features the following Yelp for Restaurants software solutions: \n- Reservations & Waitlist: Enables restaurants to easily integrate digital reservations and waitlists into their Yelp page and websites, providing diners the opportunity to join the waitlist from home (or elsewhere), with accurate seat times and live status updates that helps reduce no-shows and line-abandonment for restaurants. \n\n- Table management and POS features: Gives hosts and servers what they need for smooth front-of-house operations including custom floor maps and sections, as well as integrations with POS and other systems. \n\n- Takeout: Lets restaurants add takeout orders, track them, and notify guests via text message when their food is ready for pick up. \n\n- Kiosk: Helps teams focus on hospitality by allowing diners to check themselves into a digital waitlist upon arrival, and receive automated wait times and text notifications with their table status. Available as an add-on to Yelp Guest Manager.", "userRatingCount":948},

"description":"Avrora is a perfect sleep solution for those who would like to fall asleep easily and wake up energized with the help of special breathing techniques, meditation sessions, sleep stories, calming sounds, and refreshing alarm melodies. \n\nAvrora is based on the only extremely effective drug-free option for overcoming sleeping problems. Unlike sleeping pills, it helps to eliminate the underlying causes of sleeping problems and develop better sleep habits. \n\nHOW AVRORA WORKS\n\n*Falling asleep* \nDeep calm breathing leads to the predominance of the processes of inhibition in the central nervous system. It allows to regulate pressure and heartbeat, focus attention on breathing, thereby distracting from unwanted thoughts. Deep and controlled breathing is evolutionarily associated with a feeling of rest and relaxation. In addition, soothing sounds provide an opportunity to relax and get a positive emotion, effectively reducing the likelihood of excitation before sleep. \n\n*Sleep retention* \nBreathing technique results in a more reliable replacement of wakefulness rhythms (alpha and beta waves) with low-amplitude sleep waves (theta and delta waves), thus making sleep much more durable. Meditation sessions promote deep relaxation, bring the body to deep and lasting sleep. Bedtime meditation qualitatively improves the most fragile REM phase, which allows you to complete a full sleep cycle and feel yourself full of energy in the morning.\n\n*Awakening*\nAfter a good deep sleep, your body is restored and is ready to function in full. Pleasant alarm melodies allow you to wake up gently, gradually and with no stress. It is very important to live the first minutes of your day with positive emotions and thoughts.  \n\nWHY DO YOU NEED AVRORA? \n\nAsk yourself the following questions: \n* Do you face difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep?\n* Do you feel tired in the morning right after you wake up? \n* Do you have difficulty concentrating during the day?\n* Are you struggling to stay organized? \n* Do you feel so tired that all you can think about is sleep?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then you can definitely benefit from using Avrora app for sleep and well-being improvement.\n\nWHY AVRORA? \n\n* We help you fall asleep easily. \n* We care about your sleep during the night. \n* We wake you up smoothly with no stress. \n\nFEATURING\n* 30+ sleep boosting sounds that let you fall asleep easily without waking up at night \n* special breathing technique to unwind your mind before sleep \n* 30+ relaxing meditations for better sleep at night \n* 10+ specially designed refreshing alarm melodies that wake you up gently\n* sleep quality assessment used for all-inclusive individual sleeping solutions\n* fully integrated with Apple Health, exchanging sleep analysis, mindfulness minutes and heart rate\n* adjusting sleeping schedule\n* widgets and Siri shortcuts (including for Wind Down) \n* sign in with Apple - log into your account to save and keep your data safe across devices\n\nDownload Avrora and start treating yourself with pleasant nights and energetic mornings. \n\nAvrora offers an auto-renewing 6-month subscription for $39.99 to provide you with unlimited access to the all-inclusive sleep solution while you maintain an active subscription.

"description":"***** (5/5)  \"Word Wow is an explosion of thought-provoking, perplexing, and thrilling fun for almost all ages.\" - AppAdvice\n\nWord Wow is a word game where you make words to dig deeper into the ground. As you dig down, the worm will follow until you can guide him to the bottom before time runs out. You need to be able to make words quickly (although a no-timer mode is available) to string together bonuses, as well as just to clear the path.\n\nIf you find the worm to be stuck and you can't come up with any words, you can use a bomb to clear some of the tiles. You have a limited number of bombs, but you can earn more as you make more words. As the worm moves down the board, more letters become available.\n\nEach level has at least 1 hidden gem, and if you can find all the gems in all the levels of a world, a bonus level is opened where you can really rack up the points!\n\nThe bigger the words that you can make the more points you'll earn. Try and make enough points each level to earn all three stars.\n\nWord Wow will sharpen your brain as well as your reflexes.    Help a worm out! \n\nFeatures: \n* Fast action with the timer or relaxed mode without it\n* More than 560+ Levels and 27 colorful worlds \n* Bonus level for each world when  you collect all the gems\n* Lots of replay value as you see your ranking against all other players globally", "userRatingCount":8946},
